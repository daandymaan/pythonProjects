# Python Cryptographic Algorithms

This repository is a collection of different Cryptographic algorithms and other similar projects using python.

# Calculator using Tkinter
[Link to code](./Daniel-Simons_C17371946_LabSheet1-Calculator.py)

This project's purpose was to create a UI calculator using the Tkinter library in python.

This was my first experience in Tkinter and in UI design, it proved to be quite fun.

# Caesar Cipher and Vigenère cipher
[Link to code](./Daniel-Simons_C17371946_LabSheet2.py)

## Caesar Cipher
Caesar cipher was my first taste at programming a encryption and decryption algorithm.

This encryption algorithm's secret is that it shifts the alphabet by a specified key so that each letter is mapped to another letter (k=3 for example)

It's considered to be the simplest form of encryption and the most widely known.

## Vigenère Cipher

Vigenère cipher is a slightly more complex version of Caesar's cipher, it uses Caesar's cipher as part of a more complicated algorithm.

In this algorithm a word is used as a key rather than a number and the each letter in the key represents the equivalent letter that should be replaced for encryption.

# Hill Cipher and Monoalphabetic Cipher

## Hill Cipher

Hill cipher was the next cryptographic algorithm I was tasked with investigatio, this was another multi-letter cipher which used matrices to encrypt the messages.
To decrypt you had to use the extended euclidean algorithm.

This proved to be a difficult task but I managed to solve it after some investigation (Google).

More information about this cipher can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher)


## Monoalphabetic Cipher

In monoalphabtic cipher each letter is mapped to a different random letter of the alphabet, there is no consistent key that the alphabet is shifted to like in caesar cipher.

To solve this cipher you must use the knowledge of letter frequency, for example the letter 'e' is the most common in the english alphabet so this would be expected to appear most frequently.

# Sql in Python

This application demo'd how python can operate with SQL databases using the cx_Oracle library.

This was a simple application based on a cinema, where screens tickets and shows would all be stored in separate tables.

# Pointers in Python
[Link to code](./pointersInPython.py)

This was a simple python application to demonstrate my knowledge on how pointers work in python.

It features a node and a linked list class, and stores data and the location of the next node in the list
